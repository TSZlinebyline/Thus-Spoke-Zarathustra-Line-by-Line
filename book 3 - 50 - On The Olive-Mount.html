German translated here as schlimmer can also be “worse than” as
in not bad but worse than something else. The guest sits with him in
his home, yet Zarathustra is not home. He is heading back to his
cave, which is his home. It could be a temporary home. Combined with
the friendly hand-shaking it implies a forced intimacy with winter.
Someone Zarathustra would rather not have intruding. Blue are my
hands from his friendly hand-shacking. This is its warmth and
friendliness? A chilling to the touch. Winter a being that can not
help but force itself into your life and suck the warmth out of you.

Runs with warm feet full of body strength and warm thoughts that fill

to the olive-mount. In the bible the olive-mount is a place to lick
wounds, used by David and Jesus. Zarathustra runs from what his 
home, why is he so readily willing to abandon it? Because it is
temporary, it is not his real home the cave. Perhaps one can imagine
a student-dorm. As will be seen later the metaphor begins to shift.

	There, in his
place of sanctuary, which is not his temporary home, he could look
back at the stern guest and feel differently. Fond maybe better
translated as grateful. As in acknowledgment that it is useful, not
loved. This line with the others suggest an autobiographical of the
author. He fled from academy to Italy. One could imagine him in Basel
with strict professors who even being nice drained the warmth for
you. And here, alone and in peace, he is willing to acknowledge the
utility of such pedantic exacting men. They crush small ideas from
small people, and actively silence the noise of his home.  While it
is unpleasant to see this suffocation can be of use. Zarathustra went
from hating those types, to escaping them, to looking back with
understanding, to finally now being grateful for what they do. A
contrast to his Ape in the next session who provides negative utility
because no one one honored him. Next line,</span></p>

imagery directly sees winter as the force that wipes out pests, calms
streets, and even seems to blunt the light. If the metaphor for the
strict professors the author knew is continued the passage suggested
“Herr professor does not stand for a small mind with small ideas,
even if they bring reinforcements. He walks through the laughing
students and silence falls. Moonlight, the borrowed light from truth
associated with poor mental healthiness and cognitive impairment is
afraid of Herr professor. Next line,</span></p>

People fleeing from Herr Professor and their tyrant religious leaders
demanding too much, the tenderhearted, go to the kindergarten teacher
the warmth. Zarathustra addresses this group and explains why he
choose the natural world of the olive mount instead. He would not let
the winter sap his warmth and he will not orbit the flame of easy
scholarship and easy faith. No stick, no carrot, just becoming.  Next

evaluation. It is so true to what he is if he did not believe it he
would be someone else. Especially does he hate the fire-idols with
their almost lustful kindness. Better the harshness of real winter
that treats you as a human than the soft domestication that makes you
only fit for the being on your knees in worship. Perhaps think of the
